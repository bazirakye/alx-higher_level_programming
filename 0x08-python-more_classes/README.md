## Python Classes and Objects
A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. 
It defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects created from that class will possess. 
The attributes represent the state or characteristics of an object, while the methods define the behavior or actions the object can perform.
