# Test-driven development

unittest and doctest are two testing frameworks available in Python for writing and executing tests. They provide different approaches to writing and organizing tests.

## unittest
unittest is a built-in testing framework in Python that provides a rich set of features for writing and executing test cases. It is inspired by the JUnit testing framework from Java.

## doctest
doctest is another testing framework in Python that allows you to embed tests within docstrings of functions, modules, or classes. It can extract the test cases from the docstrings and run them.
