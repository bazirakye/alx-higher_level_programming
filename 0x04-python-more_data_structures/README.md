## Sets
A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is defined by enclosing comma-separated values in curly braces {} or by using the set() constructor.

## Dictionary
Sets are useful when you want to store a collection of items without any duplicates, and the order of the elements doesn't matter. Sets also provide mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, and difference. You can add or remove elements from a set, and you can iterate over the elements using a loop.
