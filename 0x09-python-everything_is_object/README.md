# Objects and values

## Objects
In Python, everything is an object. An object is an instance of a particular class, which defines its properties (attributes) and behavior (methods). Objects can represent simple data types like numbers and strings, as well as more complex structures like lists, dictionaries, or custom-defined classes.

## Values 
Values are the data stored within an object. Every object has a value associated with it, which may be mutable (changeable) or immutable (unchangeable). For example, integers, floats, booleans, and strings are immutable objects, meaning their values cannot be modified once created. On the other hand, lists, dictionaries, and custom objects are mutable, allowing their values to be modified.
